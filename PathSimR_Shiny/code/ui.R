                         <p>For the purposes of PathSimR, the Length of Service (or Active Service) corresponds to the amount of time a patient is actually receiving treatment or using a service.
                         It does not include any time that the patient is blocked or delayed due to capacity restraints nor any prescribed delays.
                         It represents the time between a patient starting to recieve treatment and the earliest time when they could move on, i.e. the required service time.
                         This is different to the Length of Stay which is a metric calculated as part of the simulation and includes both active treatment time and any delays which
                         may result due to the dynamics of the system.</p>

                              <h3><strong>LoS Distributions and Parameters</strong></h3>
                              <p> Rather than every patient having a length of service equal to the mean, PathSimR uses probability distributions (range of values with different probabilities) to help capture the natural variation in the data.
                              For example, using only the average LoS would ignore instances where patients have substaintially longer service times, which in turn could impact effective capacity.
                              The probability of having a certain length of service is modelled by the user chosen distributions and parameters. PathSimR includes a Service Distribution Tool, which
                              allows users to either fit models to uploaded data or scale against BNSSG data and is accessed from the Navigation Bar.</p>

                         <p>A queue in PathSimR is simply a part of the pathway in which the patient can wait for the next service point. These queues can be as small or large as required, even
                         effectively infinite (e.g. when patients simply wait at home for the next available appointment and don't wait in a physical queue). In the case where there is effectively
                         unlimited/infinite queueing capacity, the user can enter a large number (e.g. 99999) to represent a queue that will never fill.
                         In PathSimR, queues are defined by the service point in which they enter, therefore if multiple service points (e.g. A, B & C) have patients that move to service point D,
                         the queue capacity would be shared between patients from A, B & C and the capacity would be defined at service point D.
                         There are two different types of queue:External Queues and Internal Queues, which are both described below. A service point can have both types of queue.</p>

                         <h3><strong>External Queues</strong></h3>
                         <p>An external queue is defined as a queue that accepts arrivals from outside of the pathway and therefore only connect to a single service point. A full external queue
                         causes arriving patients to be lost from the system, a metric which is recorded in the outputs.
                         These are the arrivals that determine the external arrival rate, entered in step 4 on this page.
                         In the pathway visualisation later in the tool, these will appear as red arrows.</p>

                          <h3><strong>Internal Queues</strong></h3>
                          <p>An internal queue is one that connects service points within the pathway network.
                          As outlined above, internal queues are defined by the downstream service point so each service point has only 1 internal queue,
                          not a unique queue between each service point. In the case where an internal queue is full, patients will have to wait in the
                          preceeding service point until a space in the queue becomes available.</p>

                          <h3><strong>Why are there two types of queue?</strong></h3>
                          <p>The two types of queues represent different aspects of the system. Setting the external queue length allows the user to manipulate how external arrivals are treated,
                          e.g. whether they can wait until a service space becomes available or, in the case of a zero length external queue, start service if there is a space in the service point or be lost to the system.
                          Internal queues dictate how patients move & wait between service points, with a zero length internal queue representing the requirement for continuous care and will potentially result in capacity
                          driven delays. </p>

                         <h3>Transition Delays</h3>
                         <p>
                         Transition Delays are included in PathSimR to help simulate the amount of time needed to move from one unit to the next.
                         Delays can occur between any pair of service points (that have a zero length queue between them) or between a service point and an exit point.
                         The delay functions by keeping a patient in their current location while holding a space for them in their onward location (when exiting the pathway,
                         there is always space). The delays are formulated in the same way as the Length of Services, i.e. using probability distributions
                         to model variation. A fixed Transition Delay can be applied to patient using the uniform distribution and entering the same value
                         into the min and max boxes (e.g. If all patients need to have exactly a 2 day delay when exiting to a care home, select the uniform
                         distribution and enter a 2 into both parameter boxes). The Transition Delay tab in the outputs looks at the number of patients who are concurrently
                         experiencing a trasition delay through time.
                         </p>

                         <h3>Capacity Driven Departure Delays</h3>
                         <p> Even if no Transition Delays are included in the pathway, delays due to capacity can still occur. These delays are due to blocking after service
                         and arise when there is no available capacity in an onward service point and no queue to join. This forces the patient to reside in their current
                         location, stopping new patients from starting. The capacity delay ends when a space becomes available for the patient downstream. The Capacity Driven Delay
                         tab in the outputs looks at the number of patients who are concurrently experiencing a capacity driven delay through time.
                         </p>

                         <h3>What is Delay To Transfer?</h3>
                         <p>There is a output metric called 'Delay To Transfer', which looks at the amount of time between a patient finishing service and departing the service point.
                         This time is the sum of time experiencing any Capacity Driven Delay and any transition delay at a service point. This
                         metric can be found on the statistics output tabs in the Outputs section.

                         <p>
                         The warm-up period represents the time it takes for a simulation to reach stable running conditions and after which results can be recorded.
                         As each simulation starts from empty, it is important that the warm-up period be long enough so that the results collected are reflective of
                         the modelled system and not an emptier version.</p>
                         
                         <p>To determine a suitable warm-up period, first run the simulation in Trial Simulation Mode and look
                         at the resulting Warm-up Period Assistance and Average Through Time plots. The first two plots below show a stable system with a recognisable warm-up period.
                         The total in system graph stabilises around the value 30 after approximately 25 time units and all 5 metrics in the average through time graph
                         flatten out/stabilise after
                         roughly the same time period, therefore the full simulation should use a warm-up period of 25.</p>
                         <p>The second set of two plots shows an unstable system, characterised
                         by an ever increasing queue length and total number in system. This system can still be simulated but the results may not be sensible given the instability. If it is unclear
                         whether the system has stabilised, run the simulation again with a longer simulation period and update the warm-up period approximation appropriately.

                         The Simulation Period is the amount of time over which to collect results from the simulation. This will need to be sufficiently long such that
                         a large number of patients can pass through the pathway. For example, if a pathway has an average length of 365 days then simulating it for only 10
                         would not produce complete results, as unique patients would not have completed the pathway. The simulation period should therefore be longer than
                         the average pathway length and long enough to collect data. The warm-up and simulation periods sum to the total simulation length, over which the
                         external arrivals and capacity calendar will operate. Therefore, the simulation may start collecting data part way through a calendar cycle but this
                         will have no affect on the results.
